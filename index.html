      <h2>Business Overview</h2>
      <p>Jelly Ace is a popular jelly candy in the Philippines that has been enjoyed by Filipinos for generations. It was first introduced in the Philippines in the 1960s by the company General Milling Corporation, which was later acquired by Universal Robina Corporation (URC) in 2002.</p>
      <p>The candy is designed like an ace playing card and is made of jelly, therefore the name "Jelly Ace." Orange, grape, pineapple, and strawberry were the original flavors of Jelly Ace. URC has added fresh tastes over the years, including mango, blueberry, and green apple.</p>
      <p>Jelly Ace is frequently offered in tiny packets or in bulk and has grown to be a popular snack in the Philippines. As a garnish for ice cream, cakes, and other desserts, it is very frequently used. Even additional items like soda and instant beverages with the Jelly Ace flavor were inspired by the candy. Jelly Ace's sweet taste, unique texture, familiar flavors, nostalgia, and accessibility are some of the reasons why it has become a favorite among Filipinos. Gelaten Business is composed of jelly ace with a variety of flavors and condensed milk.</p>
      <p>Although it is simple, it is very delicious and can capture the taste buds of the customers. It is also very affordable, and cold condensed jelly is very timely because it's summertime in the Philippines. That's why we are determined that every customer could not resist the freshness and the deliciousness of our product.</p>
